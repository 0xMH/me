A repository that holds basic information about me that can be used for misc public facing endeavors 

### Request for me to speak at your conference

The best way to ask me to speak at your conference is to email events@nivenly.com and include the following information:

 - The name of the event
 - The best link to find out more about the event
 - Your name and contact information 
 - What type of presentation you have in mind
 - Anything else you want!
 
 These emails go directly to a private account that I own. I recieve push notifications, so I assure you - I will see this request. It might take me a while to get back to you, so please be patient.
